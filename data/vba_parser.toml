# for details of toml-syntax see https://toml.io/en/

# output directory for exported *.rst-files
# the files will be named like the Excel-File but with '*.txt' extension
# the directory must exist
# use single backslashes for windows pathes
# pathes starting with a dot like '.\VBA2Parse' are relativ to the dir current working dir

# output directory
outdir = '.\tests\integration\data\parsed'

# list of txt-files with vba-code, which should be parsed
# 
# [[filelist]] defines an toml-"array of tables"
# You can have multiple [[filelist]]-statements in your xl_codereader.toml
# Each one has to be followed by one >>path = "path\to\my\directory\with\excelfiles"<< statement
# this has to follow the same rules as >>outdir<< above
# After the path-statement there must be one >>files = [list, of, files]<< statement,
# which defines a list of files inside >>path<<
# * as wildcard is allowed
